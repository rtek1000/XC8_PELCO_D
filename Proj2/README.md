## Request:

Could you help me with a program written in C for the XC8 compiler, using interrupt to receive data? In order not to take too long the interrupt routine, only one byte should be received at a time and release the interrupt. PIC16F648A microcontroller. The microcontroller needs to receive data via USART. The microcontroller needs to recognize the data received by the serial port using the basic PELCO D protocol with 7 bytes. The PELCO D protocol has the first byte fixed with hexadecimal value 0xFF; The second byte is the Address; The third byte is Command 1; The fourth byte is Command 2; The fifth byte is Data 1; The sixth byte is Data 2; The seventh byte is the Checksum. The Checksum is the result of the sum of the two bytes; starting with the second byte and up to the sixth byte, inclusive of the sixth byte.

## Result

Key Features:
Interrupt-Driven USART Reception:

The USART receive interrupt is used to handle incoming data.

Only one byte is processed per interrupt to minimize interrupt latency.

PELCO D Protocol Handling:

The program waits for the start byte (0xFF).

It collects the 7-byte PELCO D frame and validates the checksum.

Global Variables:

A buffer (pelcoFrame) stores the incoming PELCO D frame.

A flag (frameReady) indicates when a complete frame has been received.

-----

Explanation:
USART Initialization:

The USART module is configured for a baud rate of 9600.

The receive interrupt (RCIE) is enabled to handle incoming data.

Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):

The ISR is triggered when a byte is received.

The received byte is stored in the pelcoFrame buffer.

If a complete 7-byte frame is received, the frameReady flag is set.

Main Loop:

The main loop checks the frameReady flag.

If a complete frame is ready, it processes the frame and resets the buffer and flags.

Checksum Validation:

The checksum is calculated and validated before processing the command.

Command Processing:

Replace the example logic with your specific application requirements.

Notes:
The interrupt-driven approach ensures that the microcontroller can perform other tasks while waiting for data.

Ensure the baud rate matches the configuration of the device sending the PELCO D commands.

Debugging can be done by toggling an LED or printing debug information (if a debugger is available).
