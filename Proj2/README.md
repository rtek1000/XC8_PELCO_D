## Request:

Could you help me with a program written in C for the XC8 compiler, using some pins as input and a serial output with a basic 7-byte Pelco D protocol? PIC16F648A microcontroller. The microcontroller needs to monitor 4 inputs, which will be activated with buttons. When the button is pressed, the microcontroller must understand it as a low logic signal. The data is sent via USART at 9600 baud. The microcontroller needs to form the frame data to be sent in a way that it can be expanded later. The PELCO D protocol has the first byte fixed with hexadecimal value 0xFF; The second byte is the Address; The third byte is Command 1; The fourth byte is Command 2; The fifth byte is Data 1; The sixth byte is Data 2; The seventh byte is the Checksum. The Checksum is the result of the sum of the two bytes; starting with the second byte and up to the sixth byte, including the sixth byte. The 4 buttons are for movement, 2 for horizontal (left and right sides) and another 2 buttons for vertical movement (up and down). It is possible to combine 1 vertical button with a horizontal button, as the Pelco D protocol allows this option. The movement speed is 1.

## Result

This program monitors 4 input pins (for up, down, left, and right movements) and sends the corresponding Pelco D protocol frame via USART at 9600 baud when a button is pressed.

Assumptions:
The 4 buttons are connected to PORTB (RB0, RB1, RB2, RB3).

The USART TX pin is connected to RC6.

The microcontroller is running at 4 MHz (for 9600 baud rate).

Explanation:
Button Inputs: The program monitors RB0-RB3 for button presses. When a button is pressed (logic low), the corresponding Pelco D frame is sent.

Pelco D Frame: The frame consists of 7 bytes:

Start byte: 0xFF

Address: 0x01 (can be changed as needed)

Command 1 and Command 2: Define the movement (up, down, left, right, or combinations).

Data 1 and Data 2: Define the speed (fixed at 0x20 for speed 1).

Checksum: Sum of bytes 2 to 6.

USART: The USART is configured for 9600 baud, 8-bit data, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

Combined Movements: The program supports combined movements (e.g., up + left) by checking multiple buttons simultaneously.

Notes:
The speed is fixed at 0x20 (speed 1) as per your requirement.

The program waits for the button to be released before continuing, to avoid sending multiple frames for a single press.

You can expand the program to include more commands or features as needed.
