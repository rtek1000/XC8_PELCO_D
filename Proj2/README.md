## Request:

Could you help me with a program written in C for the XC8 compiler, using some pins as input and a serial output with a basic 7-byte Pelco D protocol? PIC16F648A microcontroller. The microcontroller needs to monitor 4 inputs, which will be activated with buttons. When the button is pressed, the microcontroller must understand it as a low logic signal. The data is sent via USART at 9600 baud. The microcontroller needs to form the frame data to be sent in a way that it can be expanded later. The PELCO D protocol has the first byte fixed with hexadecimal value 0xFF; The second byte is the Address; The third byte is Command 1; The fourth byte is Command 2; The fifth byte is Data 1; The sixth byte is Data 2; The seventh byte is the Checksum. The Checksum is the result of the sum of the two bytes; starting with the second byte and up to the sixth byte, including the sixth byte. The 4 buttons are for movement, 2 for horizontal (left and right sides) and another 2 buttons for vertical movement (up and down). It is possible to combine 1 vertical button with a horizontal button, as the Pelco D protocol allows this option. The movement speed is 1. For correct identification of button combinations, it is necessary to have a priority for the combinations together with a validation time of at least 200ms, due to the fact that 2 buttons may not be pressed simultaneously. Would it be possible to perform the same functions without the program being blocked due to the button being pressed by the operator, so that other routines can be added without being affected by waiting for the button to be released?

## Result

This program monitors 4 input pins (for up, down, left, and right movements) and sends the corresponding Pelco D protocol frame via USART at 9600 baud when a button is pressed.

Assumptions:
The 4 buttons are connected to PORTB (RB0, RB1, RB2, RB3).

The USART TX pin is connected to RC6.

The microcontroller is running at 4 MHz (for 9600 baud rate).

To handle button combinations with priority and a validation time of at least 200ms, we can implement a debouncing mechanism and a priority system. The idea is to:

Debounce the buttons: Ensure that button presses are stable for at least 200ms before considering them valid.

Prioritize combinations: Check for combinations first, and if no combination is detected, check for single-button presses.

It is possible to implement the functionality without blocking the program while waiting for the button to be released. This can be achieved by using a state machine and non-blocking code. The idea is to:

Use a state machine to track the current state of the system (e.g., idle, button pressed, debouncing, etc.).

Use timers to handle debouncing and button release detection without blocking the main loop.

Allow other routines to run concurrently by avoiding while loops that wait for button releases.

Explanation:
Button Inputs: The program monitors RB0-RB3 for button presses. When a button is pressed (logic low), the corresponding Pelco D frame is sent.

Pelco D Frame: The frame consists of 7 bytes:

Start byte: 0xFF

Address: 0x01 (can be changed as needed)

Command 1 and Command 2: Define the movement (up, down, left, right, or combinations).

Data 1 and Data 2: Define the speed (fixed at 0x20 for speed 1).

Checksum: Sum of bytes 2 to 6.

USART: The USART is configured for 9600 baud, 8-bit data, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

Combined Movements: The program supports combined movements (e.g., up + left) by checking multiple buttons simultaneously.

Debounce Mechanism:

After detecting a button press, the program waits for DEBOUNCE_TIME (200ms) to ensure the button state is stable.

Only after this delay are the button states read and processed.

Priority for Combinations:

The program first checks for combinations (e.g., up + left) before checking for single-button presses.

This ensures that combinations are prioritized over single-button presses.

Wait for Button Release:

After sending a command, the program waits for all relevant buttons to be released before continuing. This prevents multiple commands from being sent for a single press.

Small Delay After Processing:

A small delay (DelayMs(100)) is added after processing a button press to avoid rapid repeated presses.

Notes:
The speed is fixed at 0x20 (speed 1) as per your requirement.

The program waits for the button to be released before continuing, to avoid sending multiple frames for a single press.

The DelayMs function is a simple loop-based delay. For more accurate timing, consider using a timer peripheral.

The program assumes a 4 MHz clock. Adjust the delay loops if your clock speed is different.

You can expand the program to include more features or commands as needed.

Key Features of the Non-Blocking Implementation:
State Machine:

The program uses a state machine (STATE_IDLE, STATE_BUTTON_PRESSED, STATE_DEBOUNCE, STATE_WAIT_RELEASE) to manage button presses and releases without blocking.

Debounce Handling:

A debounce timer is used to ensure button presses are stable for at least 200ms before being processed.

Non-Blocking Waits:

Instead of using while loops to wait for button releases, the program checks the button states in each iteration of the main loop and transitions between states accordingly.

Concurrent Execution:

Other routines or tasks can be added to the main loop without being blocked by button press handling.

Timer-Based Elapsed Time:

The GetElapsedTime function is a placeholder. You should replace it with an actual timer-based implementation to measure elapsed time accurately.

How It Works:
Idle State:

The program waits for any button to be pressed. When a button is pressed, it transitions to the STATE_BUTTON_PRESSED state.

Debounce State:

The program waits for the debounce time (200ms) to ensure the button press is stable. After the debounce time elapses, it reads the button states and sends the corresponding Pelco D frame.

Wait for Release State:

The program waits for all buttons to be released before returning to the STATE_IDLE state. This ensures that only one command is sent per button press.

Non-Blocking Execution:

The main loop continues to run, allowing other tasks or routines to execute concurrently.

Notes:
Replace the GetElapsedTime function with an actual timer-based implementation for accurate timing.

You can expand the state machine to handle additional tasks or features as needed.

This implementation is scalable and allows you to add more buttons or commands without significant changes to the structure.
